            <h2 id="page">History of the club</h2>
           Futbol Club Barcelona (in Catalan : club de futbol Barcelona) known simply as Barcelona and colloquially as (Barça), is a professional football club based in <span class="specific">Barcelona, Catalonia</span>, Spain.
           Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, English and Catalan footballers led by <span class="specific">Juan Gamper</span>, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture , hence the motto <span class="specific">"Més que un club"</span> ("More than a club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third most valuable sports team in the world, worth $4.07 billion, and the world's third richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €648.3 million. The official Barcelona anthem is the <span class="specific">"Cant del Barça"</span>, written by <span class="specific">Jaume Picas</span> and <span class="specific">Josep Maria Espinàs</span>.
           Domestically, Barcelona has won 25 <span class="specific">La Liga</span>, 30 <span class="specific">Copa del Rey</span>, 13 <span class="specific">Supercopa de España</span>, 3 <span class="specific">Copa Eva Duarte</span> and 2 <span class="specific">Copa de la Liga</span> trophies, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, Barcelona has won 20 European and World titles: 5 <span class="specific">UEFA Champions League</span> titles, a record 5 <span class="specific">UEFA Super Cup</span>, a record 3 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and a joint record 3 <span class="specific">Club World Cup</span> . Barcelona was ranked first in the <span class="specific">International Federation of Football History & Statistics</span> Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2015 and currently occupies the second position on <span class="specific">UEFA club rankings</span>.The club has a long-standing rivalry with <span class="words">Real Madrid</span> matches between the two teams are referred to as <span class="words">El Clásico</span>.
           Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media following in the world among sports teams. Barcelona players have won a record number of <span class="specific">Ballon d'Or awards</span>  (11), with recipients including <span class="specific">Johan Cruyff</span>, as well as a record number of FIFA World Player of the Year awards (7), with winners including <span class="specific">Ronaldo</span>, <span class="specific">Romario</span>, <span class="specific">Ronaldinho</span> and <span class="specific">Rivaldo</span>. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy (<span class="specific">Lionel Messi</span> , <span class="specific">Andrés Iniesta</span> and <span class="specific">Xavi</span>) were chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat for players from the same football school.
           Barcelona is one of three founding members of the <span class="specific">Primera División</span> that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with <span class="specific">Athletic Bilbao</span> and <span class="specific">Real Madrid</span>. In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. In 2011, the club became European champions again and won five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won 14 trophies in just 4 years under <span class="specific">Pep Guardiola</span> , is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time. By winning their fifth Champions League trophy on<span class="specific">6 June 2015</span> , Barcelona became the first European club in history to achieve the continental treble twice. The highest paid sports team in the world, in November 2018 Barcelona became the first sports team with average first-team pay in excess of £10m ($13.8m) per year.

        <h1 class="static-page__title">Values</h1>

        <p>
            <strong>RESPECT</strong>
            <br>
            Respect for others is one of the basic requirements of democratic life and the capacity to live in society. It affects the individual and has both a social and a collective dimension. Respect is a fundamental part of sport, for sport generates situations of tension that have to be resolved almost instantaneously. There is therefore a need, above rules and standards, for this value to be present in order to guarantee cordial and correct interrelations between people. In sport, respect is needed in similar situations to those where it is demanded in wider society, but the intensity of the moment implies that the presence or absence of respect can be very obvious and can affect the development of the situation or event.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>EFFORT</strong>
            <br>
            There are many social models that avoid effort and advocate instead luck, opportunism and immediate triumph. However, effort is a value that can take us to unthinkable heights and lead us to achieve targets and objectives that may at other times appear distant or inaccessible. Dedication, rigour, constancy, sacrifice and perseverance all bear fruit, while luck and the search for a quick win are often fleeting and momentary. Note that at school, teachers have for a long time being promoting a culture of effort as the vehicle for academic development and personal achievement, and this helps to construct new social models.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>AMBITION</strong>
            <br>
            Ambition is the desire to achieve the maximum performance and do things not only well but also as well as is feasibly possible and to improve every day. This value is applicable both to individuals and to groups. It involves use of a web of values as varied as excellence, patience, discipline, order, motivation and responsibility. Indeed, ambition invokes and requires a broad system of values and, in turn, is related with a job being done well, effort and rigour. Regarding targets, ambition is probably the surest way of achieving them, for it is the impulse to grow.
        </p>
        <P>
            <strong>TEAMWORK</strong>
            <br>
            Teamwork implies that the subject forms part of a group and that, as a member of the same, becomes an active element that acts on behalf of the whole (sometimes even to the determine of their own individuality). There are undeniable benefits of knowing that you are part of a team and this requires the learning and accentuation of many other values.
        </P>
        <p>
            <strong>HUMILITY</strong>
            <br>
            Often when athletes, and people in general, achieve the goals they have set themselves, they start feeling superior in physical, moral, economic and other terms, and this leads them to forget certain values that have in all probability helped them to achieved those very goals: effort, perseverance, self-control, etc. We are all aware of how FC Barcelona has dealt with its victories of recent years, and how it has always shown humility (and also such values as effort, rigour, responsibility and others) to win respect in its field, and among its opponents, and generally everyone. Humility probably consists of knowing how to be clear about one’s values, and to maintain them and defend them even in situations where you are clearly superior and more successful.
